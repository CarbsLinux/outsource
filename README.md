Carbs Outsource Repository
==========================

This is a repository for getting 3rd party packages
that are not maintained by Carbs Linux. This is also
meant to be a concept repository which is why our fork
of `kiss` handles submodules. Please see the relevant
post at <https://carbslinux.org/blog/20200410.html>.

You can get this repository by cloning recursively.

    -> git clone --recursive https://github.com/CarbsLinux/outsource

Note that the package manager in KISS Linux doesn't
have submodule support, so it will not be updated by
running `kiss u`.
